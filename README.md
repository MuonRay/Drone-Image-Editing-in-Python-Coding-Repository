# Drone-Image-Editing-in-Python-Coding-Repository
A selection of custom developed python codes for use in various drone imaging applications, such as batch conversion of DNG (RAW) drone images to JPEG or PNG, use of the rawpy library features of demosaicing, gamma factor correction and use of skimage library to demonstrate histogram histogram equalization in colour images to create better contrast and depth. This repository also increases coding developed for use in generating panorama composite images both in JPG and DNG format, a very useful technique in high definition aerial imagery and makes use of the SIFT algorithm in Python's OpenCV image stitcher function. These codes are open for use in educational and demonstration uses and for non-profit organisations.
